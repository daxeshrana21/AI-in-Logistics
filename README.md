# Guess the Number Game!

## Step 1: Plan the Project

**1. Purpose of the Project:**
        The project is a game that created using Python programming. It serves also to user basics understanding of programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, input/output, and working with modules.  In the game, the computer will choose a number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess that number within a certain number of attempts.

**2. Features of the program:**

        The game has following features, including:

        - Generating a random number: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and ask to the user for guess number.

        - Receiving user input: The program prompts the user to input their guess.

        - Feedback on guesses: After each guess, Provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.

        - High score: The program keeps track of the player's best score (Number of attempts)

        - Timer: It also keeps track of the time it takes the player to guess the correct number.

        - Sounds: The program plays different sound effects depending on wins or loses the game.

        - Quitting the game: The program allows the user to quit the game at any time by typing "quit".

**3. Requirements and Dependencies of Project:**
     
        - The dependencies required for this project are the random, time, and winsound modules. 
        - Random module is used to generate a random number.
        - Time module is used to track the time it takes the player to guess the number.
        - Winsound module is used to play sound effects when the player wins or loses the game.

        - Requirements: Visual Studio Code, Python
